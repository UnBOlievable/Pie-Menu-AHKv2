EndofList




To Add a new Function, add the 2-digit list number, the name of the function label in the script ("_" should be spaces in this document), add a ":" and then a description of the function.  Don't touch the EndofList text and leave a line break between that and your functions.  The Function labels shown here correspond to the label to the functions of the script, if the names are changed, their corresponding function label must be changed in the PieMenu.ahk script file.
Example:

...
21Your Neat Function:Does all the cool stuff you programmed in the Your_Neat_Function label in the PieMenu.ahk file.

"In the Pie Menu.ahk script"
Your_Neat_Function:
	{
	BlockLButton := 0
	;More function code
	Return
	}
