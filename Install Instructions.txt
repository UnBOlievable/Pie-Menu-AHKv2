Who's awesome?



It's you.

Run "Pie Menu App.exe" and follow prompts.  AutoHotKey will be installed from the internet if you do not have it, just allow the installation when it comes up.

If you want the pie menus to run without going through the Pie Menu App GUI just run PieManager.ahk.

When the Pie Menu's are running, use Ctrl + Alt + 'Pie Key' to open the Pie Menu Settings for the active profile.
You can also press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Pie Key to close the scripts related to the Pie Menus.
